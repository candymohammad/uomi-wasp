# UOMI Agent: uomi-agent.wasm

## Overview
This file is a WebAssembly (WASM) module designed to operate as an agent within the UOMI platform.  
It was compiled into the standard WASM binary format (version 1), ensuring portability, safety, and deterministic execution.

The agent is self-contained, lightweight (~7.8 KB), and optimized for execution in sandboxed environments such as UOMI’s runtime.

---

## Purpose of the Agent
The agent provides a set of functions that allow it to:
- Interact with the UOMI runtime safely.
- Process inputs (tasks, messages, or events).
- Produce outputs in a deterministic manner.
- Expose well-defined entry points (exports) that UOMI can call to perform its operations.

This design makes the agent reliable for decentralized or distributed workflows, ensuring that its logic can be executed and verified consistently.

---

## Structure and Behavior
- Binary type: WebAssembly v1 (.wasm)
- Exports: Functions exposed by the agent that UOMI can call.  
  These usually include initialization, task handling, and returning results.
- Imports: Any runtime functions the agent relies on (e.g., logging, memory allocation, environment calls).

When loaded by UOMI:
1. The runtime instantiates the WASM module.
2. The agent’s initialization function is invoked to set up memory and state.
3. UOMI calls the exported agent functions to handle tasks.
4. The agent processes data and responds deterministically.
5. Memory is managed securely via WASM’s sandboxing model.

## Agent Characteristics
- Deterministic execution → ensures reproducible results.
- Sandboxed → isolated from the host, preventing unsafe operations.
- Lightweight → small binary size enables fast deployment.
- Portable → can run in any WASM-compatible environment.

---

## Why This Agent Works for UOMI
- Conforms to UOMI’s requirement of agents being shipped as WASM binaries.
- Provides clear entry points for interaction with the platform.
- Ensures safe execution with minimal overhead.
- Ready for deployment and integration into UOMI’s agent framework.

## Conclusion
This agent (uomi-agent.wasm) is a self-contained, efficient WebAssembly module that can be directly integrated into the UOMI ecosystem. It exposes well-defined functions for the runtime, executes deterministically, and fully respects WASM’s sandboxing guarantees — making it a secure and reliable UOMI agent.
